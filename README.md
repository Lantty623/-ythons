Concept: \
-- Step tracker application for mobile platforms that converts user steps to a step of an animal 

Documentation: \
User Stories and Scope and the Team Structure document are under documentation folder.

Testing Instructions: \
-- Download and install Animal Stepper apk (Called "app-debug.apk" in GitHub)  \
-- Install (if not already) and open the "Health Connect" app : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata \
-- In the Health Connect app, give the Animal Stepper app permissions for step data \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- In Health Connect, you you should be able to see the Animal Stepper app as listed for requesting permissions. Select Animal Stepper from this menu and enable Step permissions \
-- Walk and then see facts and images of the animal you choose from the drop down menu 

Troubleshooting: \
-- Make sure you have internet connection 
-- If you have no step data showing up in Animal Stepper, make sure you have another fitness app that is reading in footstep data for you \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Animal Stepper will not record your footsteps by itself, but instead requires another app that will record your footsteps and upload data to Health Connect \
-- In order to see updates to the number of steps you have, you need to reselect an animal option from the dropdown menu
